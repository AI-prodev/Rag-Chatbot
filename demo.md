Write a Jira ticket about:
```
Currently, in case of any error, the client will receive an unexpected error with a fixed message with an HTTP status
code 500 without the trace information. The error trace is logged only. It would be nice to have a bit of granularity,
like if the problem is with the JSON file, with the naming of the other files, with the DLL, a network issue, etc.
```
