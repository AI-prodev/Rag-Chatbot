# Contextual ChatBot with GPT4All, LangChain and Chroma

This project combines the power of [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html),
[GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) and [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) to accomplish a specific task.
It works by taking a collection of Markdown files as input and, when asked a question, provides the corresponding answer
based on the context provided by those files.

The `Memory Builder` component of the project loads Markdown pages from the `docs` folder.
It then divides these pages into smaller sections, calculates the embeddings (a numerical representation) of these
sections with the [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) 
`sentence-transformer`, and saves them in an embedding database called [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) 
for later use.

When a user asks a question, the ChatBot retrieves the most relevant sections from the Embedding database.
These sections are then used as context to generate the final answer using a local language model (LLM).

Additionally, the chatbot is designed to remember previous interactions. It saves the chat history and considers the
relevant context from previous conversations to provide more accurate answers. 

> Disclaimer: The code has been tested on `Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS` running on a Lenovo Legion 5 Pro
> with twenty `12th Gen IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-12700H`.
> If you are using another Operating System or different hardware and you can't load the models, please
> take a look at the official GPT4All's GitHub [issue](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all/issues).

> Note: it's important to note that the GPT4All language model sometimes generates hallucinations or false information.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ and Poetry.

### Install Poetry

Install Poetry by following this [link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

## ðŸ›  Bootstrap Environment

To easily install the dependencies I created a make file.

### How to use the make file

* Check: ```make check```
  * Use It to check that `which pip3` and `which python3` points to the right path.
* Install: ```make install```
  * Creates an environment and installs all dependencies.
* Update: ```make update```
  * Update an environment and installs all updated dependencies.
* Tidy up the code: ```make tidy```
  * Run Isort, Black and Flake8.
* Clean: ```make clean```
  * Removes the environment and all cached files.

> Note: Run `Install` as your init command (or after `Clean`).

## Using the Open-Source GPT4All's Models Locally

We use [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html), an open-source collection of models trained on top of Facebookâ€™s LLaMA,
which released its weights under a commercial/non-commercial license. 
Still, running the mentioned architecture on your local PC is impossible due to the large (~7 billion) number of 
parameters. The main contribution of `GPT4All` models is the ability to run them on a `CPU`.
The authors applied `Quantization and 4-bit precision` using the [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) format.
Basically, the model uses fewer bits to represent the numbers.
`LangChain` library uses [PyLLaMAcpp](https://github.com/abdeladim-s/pyllamacpp) module (`pyllamacpp==1.0.7`) to load 
the converted `GPT4All` weights.

> Note: The Quantized model has been tested only with `langchain = "^0.0.215"`

### Supported Models
* [WizardLM's WizardLM 7B GGML](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/wizardLM-7B-GGML)
* [Llama2 7B Chat GGML](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML)
  * Supported for the simple chat only.

## Example Data

You could download some Markdown pages from the [Blendle Employee Handbook](https://blendle.notion.site/Blendle-s-Employee-Handbook-7692ffe24f07450785f093b94bbe1a09) 
and put them under `docs`.

## Build the memory index

Run:
```shell
python chat/memory_builder.py --chunk-size 1000
```

## Run a simple Chatbot

Type:
```shell
python chat/simple_chat.py
```

## Run the Contextual Chatbot

Run:
```shell
python chat/chatbot_memory_streaming.py --k 1 --n-threads 4
```
