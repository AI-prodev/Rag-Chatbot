# Contextual ChatBot with GPT4All, LangChain and Chroma

This project combines the power of [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) and 
[GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) to accomplish a specific task. 
It works by taking a collection of Markdown files as input and, when asked a question, provides the corresponding answer
based on the context provided by those files.

The `Memory Builder` component of the project loads Markdown pages from the `docs` folder.
It then divides these pages into smaller sections, calculates the embeddings (a numerical representation) of these 
sections, and saves them in a database called [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) for later use.

When a user asks a question, the ChatBot retrieves the most relevant sections from the Embedding database. 
These sections are then used as context to generate the final answer using a local language model (LLM).

Additionally, the chatbot is designed to remember previous interactions. It saves the chat history and considers the 
relevant context from previous conversations to provide more accurate answers. However, it's important to note that 
the GPT4All language model sometimes generates incorrect or fabricated information, 
which can lead to false information being provided.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ and Poetry.

### Install Poetry

Install Poetry by following this [link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

## ðŸ›  Bootstrap Environment

To easily install the dependencies I created a make file.

### How to use the make file

* Check: ```make check```
  * Use It to check that `which pip3` and `which python3` points to the right path.
* Setup: ```make setup```
  * Creates an environment, installs all dependencies, initialize pre-commit.
* Install: ```make install```
  * Creates an environment and installs all dependencies.
* Install pre-commit: ```make install_pre_commit```
  * Initialize pre-commit.
* Clean: ```make clean```
  * Removes the environment and all cached files.

**Note:** Run `Setup` as your init command (or after `Clean`)

## Using the Open-Source GPT4All Model Locally

We use [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html), a model trained on top of Facebookâ€™s LLaMA model, which released its weights under a 
non-commercial license. Still, running the mentioned architecture on your local PC is impossible due to the 
large (7 billion) number of parameters. The main contribution of GPT4All models is the ability to run them on a CPU.
The authors applied Quantization and 4-bit precision. So, the model uses fewer bits to represent the numbers.

### Convert the Model

The first step is to download the weights and use a script from the `LLaMAcpp` repository to convert the weights from 
the old format to the new one (ggml-formatted). It is a required step; otherwise, the `LangChain` library will not identify the 
checkpoint file.
Use the `download_model.py` Python script to breaks down the file into multiple chunks and downloads them gradually.
This process might take a while since the file size is 4GB. 
The `local_path` variable is the destination folder.

```shell
python download_model.py
```

Transform the downloaded file to the latest format:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
python llama.cpp/convert.py ./models/gpt4all-lora-quantized-ggml.bin
rm -rf llama.cpp
```

## Build the memory index

Run:
```shell
python chat/memory_builder.py --chunk-size 1000
```

## Run the Chatbot

Run:
```shell
python chat/chatbot_memory_streaming.py
```
